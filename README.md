# TSP Solver Project

This project implements three algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search.

## Description
This project is designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using three different search algorithms:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- **A* Search**

The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city, minimizing the longest distance between two consecutive cities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Git

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AlexGugila/tsp-solver.git
    cd tsp-solver
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Usage
To run the TSP solvers, execute the `main.py` script. You can do this by using the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python main.py
